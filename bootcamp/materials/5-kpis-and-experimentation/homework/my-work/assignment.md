# YouTube Music and Podcasts
In 2024, Google Podcasts was merged into YouTube Music. As someone who uses two phones—an Android and an iPhone—I primarily enjoyed the iPhone’s podcast app because it was my most-used device. The iPhone app offered a similar but superior user experience compared to the Google Podcasts app, which I had used extensively until 2023. However, in mid-2024, I switched back to using my Android phone and struggled to adapt to the podcast experience within YouTube Music. While I am a frequent user of YouTube Music for listening to music, the podcast experience feels subpar. My sister, also a regular user of the Google Podcasts app, has shared similar complaints about the new experience. To address these issues, I have designed three experiments aimed at improving the podcast experience, re-engaging users, and increasing overall listening time.

## Experiment 1: Adding a Podcast Ribbon Closer to the Top
**Objective:** Content positioned within the top three rows typically captures user attention. Currently, podcasts are not prominently displayed, and new content is not directly promoted. Users must either click the podcast button to filter content or scroll to the bottom of the app. This experiment aims to determine whether placing a podcast ribbon as the second or third row improves podcast discoverability and consumption. The goal is to assess how this change affects overall user engagement with podcasts and music.

**Hypotheses:**
* Null Hypothesis 1: Adding a top ribbon does not affect podcast consumption.
* Alternative Hypothesis 1: Adding a top ribbon increases podcast consumption.
* Null Hypothesis 2: Adding a top ribbon does not affect music consumption.
* Alternative Hypothesis 2: Adding a top ribbon decreases music consumption.

**Metrics:**
* Leading Metric: Number of app users.
* Lagging Metrics: Listening time for podcasts, music, and overall.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
* 25%: YouTube Music only (standard view).
* 25%: YouTube Music only (new view).
* 25%: Both apps (standard view).
* 5%: Both apps (new view).

## Experiment 2: Introducing a “Podcast Queue” Feature
**Objective:** Users often enjoy adding recommended or searched content to their queue or “play next” list. Currently, music and podcast content can be mixed, which some users dislike, as they prefer separate listening sessions for music and podcasts. This experiment introduces a “Podcast Queue” feature, allowing users to queue podcast episodes separately. Once played, episodes would automatically be removed from the queue. The aim is to evaluate whether this feature increases podcast listening time.

**Hypotheses:**
* Null Hypothesis: Adding a “Podcast Queue” does not change podcast listening time.
* Alternative Hypothesis: Adding a “Podcast Queue” changes podcast listening time.

**Metrics:**
* Leading Metric: Number of app users.
* Lagging Metrics: Listening time for podcasts, music, and overall.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
* 50%: Standard queue functionality.
5* 0%: New “Podcast Queue” feature.

## Experiment 3: Reordering Podcast Ribbons
**Objective:** Currently, when users click the podcast button, two ribbons appear at the top:
Subscribed shows (with a one-click play option for a chronological playlist).
New episodes from subscribed channels.
This experiment investigates whether swapping the order of these ribbons affects user engagement, including overall listening time and the variety of content consumed.

**Hypotheses:**
* Null Hypothesis 1: Changing the order of ribbons does not change podcast listening time.
* Alternative Hypothesis 1: Changing the order of ribbons changes podcast listening time.
* Null Hypothesis 2: Changing the order of ribbons does not change the variety of podcasts consumed.
* Alternative Hypothesis 2: Changing the order of ribbons changes the variety of podcasts consumed.

**Metrics:**
* Leading Metrics: Number of app users, number of subscribed podcasts.
* Lagging Metrics: Listening time for podcasts, music, and overall; number of different channels listened to.

**Test Cell Allocation:**
* 50%: Current ribbon order.
* 50%: New ribbon order.
